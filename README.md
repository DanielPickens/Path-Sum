Given the root of a binary tree and an integer Sum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.



 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], Sum = 22
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3], Sum = 5
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], Sum = 0
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= Sum <= 1000
